Some helpers for GHC Core and [HERMIT](https://github.com/ku-fpg/hermit/).
To do: offer to HERMIT folks for inclusion.

Requires GHC 7.8.2 or later.

Assumes some old versions of KU software:

*   KURE, [commit 7ce26aa](https://github.com/ku-fpg/kure/commit/7ce26aa)
*   HERMIT, [commit 5557609](https://github.com/ku-fpg/hermit/commit/5557609)

To use these versions, clone the repos (or pull if already cloned), and use "git checkout <commit-id>".
